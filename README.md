# 🐳 Project Phoenix: The Docker Path Apprenticeship
This repository documents the full learning journey of a Junior DevOps Engineer (Alex) at Innovatech Labs through a comprehensive, hands-on apprenticeship program focused on modern application containerization and orchestration. This project serves as a showcase of foundational to advanced Docker skills, culminating in the deployment of a three-tier application stack.

## 🚀 Overview
The goal of the training, overseen by Dr. A. Sharma, Head of Infrastructure Engineering, was to transition from being a consumer of pre-built images to an architect of modern, containerized applications. The journey involved 9 key challenges, each introducing a critical concept in the Docker ecosystem.

## 💡 Core Learning Objectives
This project demonstrates practical mastery over the following concepts:
- Container Fundamentals: Pulling, running, and managing the lifecycle of single containers.
- Image Creation: Authoring custom Dockerfiles to package applications and solve the "it works on my machine" problem.
- Data Persistence: Safeguarding application state using Docker Volumes for persistent data storage (e.g., databases).
- Development Workflow: Utilizing Bind Mounts and tools like nodemon to create efficient, live-reloading local development environments.
- Networking: Creating custom Docker Networks to enable secure communication between application and database containers.
- Orchestration: Using Docker Compose to define, launch, and manage entire multi-container application stacks with a single, declarative file (docker-compose.yml).
- Image Optimization: Implementing Multi-Stage Builds to produce lean, production-ready images free of development dependencies.
- Security & Secrets: Remediating hardcoded secrets by leveraging .env files and the env_file directive in Docker Compose.
